1 Modify Makefile to respond to file change even if executable exists DONE

2 How to draw lines with different widths (pass a different value to glPointSize)

3 Plan for array

When fill mode is on, check drawing member of canvas object and fill in the canvas array (first
borders, then fills).
Then refresh the window and display the array.
When user clicks inside a polygon, change the array elements, refresh and display the array again

When fill mode is off, refresh the window and display using the line and polygon draw methods

(above idea is deprecated)

Use 2D array to store all points where the user has clicked and with what color they have clicked. The 2D array is used only as a reference. It is never actually 'displayed'. When the user clicks on a point, we fill up the area and assign the corresponding elements of the 2D array the appropriate pixel colors.
